# Flash Anzan
Soroban operations building algorithm based on the different Soroban levels. Focused specifically on Mental solving training (Anzan) for Soroban. 

Each level has different restrictions for either adding or substracting. The algorithm has to take this restricton into account when generating a random operation for the selected level. 
A functional flash anzan will be published on www.soroban.mx once a minimum viable model is developed.
